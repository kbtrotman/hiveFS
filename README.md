# hiveFS
A Hive Mind Filesystem

The problem with describing what I'm trying to do here is similar to trying to describe a helicopter to someone who's never seen an airplane or copter. It's new, and not much like anything currently available. It's de-dupe, but that's a small part of it. It's a global filesystem, but it's not meant to be a GF, it's just one as a result of the final goal. There is no moniker to describe it. So, I'll try my best.

Virtualization is huge, and everything is virtualized, even storage to a degree. But is storage really virtualized? We can turn a physical lun into a "virtual lun" but what have we really done to virtualize it beyond just changing how its presented? A hive mind is a full virtualization of the underlying storage, far beyond anything else that's existed. It extends de-dupe from a single filesystem or device across as many hosts as you need/want. What I'm "developing" is hiveFS, but even hiveFS is just a driver to enable the true function here, which is a virtual storage appliance built on either open source software or Enterprise-grade software/hardware. A single appliance that can serve storage to any number of hosts, physical or virtual, limited only by how many disks you can put behind it. The only thing that will be stored locally for any machine is the filesystem superblock. The hiveFS software will then point to a remote hive that stores everyone's data using the hive version of the hiveFS software. That sounds like current arrays, you say? Well, an array is presented on a lun level, and technically the filesystem applied to that lun has to be permanently attached to that machine at a hardware level. This is similar, but yet again, not at all what I'm doing. There are no luns. There's only a shared filesystem, which requires a small underlying lun for the superblock (less than 1mb). For the rest of the filesystem, it's virtualized with no underlying storage setup, except what you physically setup on the appliance to attach to the global hive. The hive shares storage as a blob, so a local host would only be limited by the user quotas so long as there's storage on the remote appliance. (The superblock is necessary because I'm not greedy here. I don't want to try and revolutionize everything that's a filesystem at the moment....although, I admit my goals are pretty drastic here...you could even say far-fetched, so I'm sticking to what I know and is familiar at the moment.)

Though I'm very much not a windows developer, the eventual goal here is to support both linux and windows, the primary O/S's for virtualization and the biggest footprint for O/S's in general today. The goal beyond the local filesystem kernel module is support for VMWare API at present for datastore use or direct from the appliance viat network or Infiniband. Although FC is feasable, current technologies are fast and reliable via network, so expenditure in legacy FC is really not a priority.
